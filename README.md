# Start picoCTF Problem Development

Hello and welcome to the official documentation for our Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
challenge manager! This guide is designed to help you navigate and utilize the
features of this powerful tool to create and configure your own CTF problems.

This documentation is currently maintained by Luke 'syreal' Jones. If you have
any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to reach out via email
[here](mailto:other@picoctf.org).

Our team has been exclusively using
[cmgr](https://github.com/picoCTF/cmgr/releases/latest) for problem development
over the past few years. This tool is tightly integrated with Docker, ensuring a
robust and flexible environment for your CTF challenges. With cmgr, you can
easily bring your challenge ideas to life and provide an engaging experience for
participants.

Whether you are a seasoned CTF organizer or new to the scene, this documentation
will guide you through every step of using cmgr, from installation and setup to
advanced customization and challenge configuration.

Let's get started on turning your CTF dreams into reality!
