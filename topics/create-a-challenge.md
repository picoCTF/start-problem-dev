# Creating a challenge

This is an outline of a problem creation process that works and includes some of
the needs we have for picoCTF (like filling out the Use of Work form). This is
just a suggestion, feel free to develop challenges however feels right to you!

- Get an idea for a challenge
- Reach out to us via [email](mailto:other@picoctf.org)
- Create a **private** GitHub repository for your challenge(s)
- Write a proof-of-concept challenge
- Theme or provide flavor for the challenge
- Package the challenge for cmgr
- Test the challenge in cmgr
- Write a solve script
- Add `syreal17` as a collaborator on your repo
- Fill out and send the [Use of Work form](/Agreement%20for%20use%20of%20work_picoCTF.pdf)
- Receive feedback
- Observe your challenge in the next competition!
