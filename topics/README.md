# Topical Index

Here we have gathered some of the most common questions for developing cmgr
challenges and provided short answers with examples of how to do certain things.

- [Creating a challenge](/topics/create-a-challenge.md). Here's an overview of
  the process of creating a challenge from an idea to a deployable cmgr
  challenge.
- [Adding downloadable artifact](/topics/adding-artifact.md). Most challenges
  will require interacting with a file artifact. Here's how to present artifacts
  to players.
- [Playtesting a challenge](/setup-cmgr.md#configure-cmgr). Testing your
  challenge is a critical step in developing your challenge.
- [Testing methodology](/example-problems/sanity-static-flag/README.md#testing).
  Minimal steps in testing a new challenge.
- [Creating a dynamic flag](/example-problems/forensics-grep/). Check out this
  example problem to learn how to create a dynamic flag.
- [Writing and using a cmgr solver](/topics/cmgr-solver.md). Learn how to make
  use of cmgr's built-in problem checker.
- [Addressing
  cheesing](/example-problems/forensics-disk/README.md#the-problem-of-cheesing).
  Presents some strategies to mitigate the problem of cheesing.
- [Adding extra instanced data](/topics/instanced-data.md). Some challenges
  require extra instance-specific data, like an SSH password.
