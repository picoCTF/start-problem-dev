# Crypto Oracle Problem

## Pre-requisites

1. You have `cmgr` installed and configured.
    - Refer to the [setup page](/setup-cmgr.md) if this is not the case for you.

2. You have done the [Reversing Python Problem Creation
   Walkthrough](/example-problems/reversing-python/). The Reversing Python
   walkthrough is a more basic example of using a single container for cmgr
   problem development. The file changes presented here will be as compared to
   Reversing Python.

## Overview

This is a complex problem that uses both file artifacts and a live service to
challenge the player to take advantage of an issue with "textbook RSA". There
isn't necessarily any new techniques used for this challenge, but it's a new
level of complexity compared to other challenges in these walkthroughs.
