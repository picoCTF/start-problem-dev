# Sanity

This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to set up and validate a
sanity problem with `cmgr`.

A sanity problem is a straightforward task used in Capture the Flag (CTF)
competitions. It serves as a preliminary check to ensure that your internet
connection is stable and all other system assumptions are correctly configured.

This sanity challenge is a simple download of the flag in the file `flag.txt`.

## Pre-requisites

1. You have `cmgr` installed.
    - Refer to the [setup page](/setup-cmgr) if this is not the
      case for you.

## Overview

We're starting with a sanity problem because it is the simplest challenge that
exists in every CTF. We will demonstrate creating a very simple Docker container
that just copies in `flag.txt` and makes it a downloadable artifact for cmgr and
sets the flag for the challenge appropriately.

The following walkthrough has 3 parts:

1. File listing. We will go over every file in the challenge directory.

2. Deployment. We will demonstrate deploying this challenge for testing.

3. Testing. We will demonstrate a good place to start with testing any
   challenge.

### File Listing

  1. [Dockerfile](/example-problems/sanity-static-flag/Dockerfile) builds the
      container used for the challenge. A container is required for every
      challenge with cmgr. This file is heavily commented to explain what each
      Docker command does. Please refer to the file itself for further
      explanation.
  1. [problem.md](/example-problems/sanity-static-flag/problem.md) specifies the
      name of the problem, the description, and other metadata about the
      problem. Though this is a Markdown file, it is actually parsed by cmgr.
      Here is the
      [specification](https://github.com/picoCTF/cmgr/blob/master/examples/specification.md)
      for this file in general. We will go over some specifics here:
        - The first heading is the name of your problem as it will appear on the
          platform.
        - The first block contains important cmgr metadata and some
          problem-specific values.
            - `Namespace` this is the namespace in cmgr that your problem will
              be named under. Please use: `Namespace: picoctf`
            - `ID` this is the actual name of the problem for cmgr. If not
              specified, it will be the first heading converted to all lowercase
              and hyphens, but we like to specify it directly.
            - `Type` this should always be `Type: custom`
            - `Category` this should probably be "General Skills," "Forensics,"
              "Reverse Engineering," "Cryptography," "Binary Exploitation," or
              "Web Exploitation" but we might entertain other categories in the
              future.
            - `Points` this should be `Points: 1`. We won't know the points for
              any given challenge until we can calibrate them with the rest of
              the challenges in a competition.
            - `Templatable` this is a bookkeeping value (which means it serves
              no functional purpose, it only exposes the intentions of the
              challenge developer) which indicates whether a challenge has a
              static or dynamic flag. We try to keep as many flags dynamic as
              possible as it helps us catch cheaters and allows us to regenerate
              the instance flags if we need.
            - `MaxUsers` is another bookkeeping value which indicates whether
              instances of the challenge will be shared (`MaxUsers: 0`) or
              whether each user will get their own container (`MaxUsers: 1`). We
              call challenges where every user gets their own container
              "On-Demand". Indicate On-Demand if your container or service has
              mutable state. Any challenge that makes it to the Gym becomes
              On-Demand, because these are less expensive to host in the
              long-run.
        - The `Description` section is where you can explain your problem at a
          high level or provide flavor. Please put artifact download links here
          as the Details section is not visible for On-Demand challenges until
          after the container(s) start.
        - The `Details` section is where you can put instance connection
          information. See the
          [spec](https://github.com/picoCTF/cmgr/blob/master/examples/specification.md)
          for more details. It can be empty if there is nothing relevant to
          include.
        - The `Hints` section should contain an unordered list of hints, but on
          the picoCTF platform these hints will be numbered in the order that
          they appear. This section can be empty. In our Gym, hints range from a
          mini-walkthrough for more pedagogical problems to frustratingly
          obscure references that don't really help until after you solve the
          challenge.
        - The `Solution Overview` is technically optional but we rely heavily on
          it to determine difficulty, and to verify working instances so please
          include it in reasonable detail.
        - The `Challenge Options` are actual container options that are applied
          to your container(s). These are used to limit the amount of resources
          that any given container can consume. The default options given are
          sort of a minimum starting point. These options only apply to
          containers that the players actually interact with. If everything
          seems good, but your services won't start, you might have to bump up
          these challenge options. However, they can't be too high, otherwise we
          won't be able to support this challenge for the thousands of users
          that we see in competitions. See [this
          page](https://github.com/picoCTF/cmgr/blob/master/examples/specification.md#challenge-options)
          for more detailed explanation.
        - The `Learning Objective` is also optional but is very useful to us as
          a one sentence statement about what a challenge aims to teach.
        - The `Attributes` section can mostly be ignored by challenge authors,
          but please include the author line you want to be published with your
          challenge.
  1. [flag.txt](/example-problems/sanity-static-flag/flag.txt). This is what
     everyone is trying to get! We pass it into our container, and it creates a
     tarball out of it called `artifacts.tar.gz` which cmgr looks for so it can
     provide links in the Description or Details of problem.md.

### Deployment

Follow [these steps](/setup-cmgr#test-cmgr) to deploy the sanity check
problem.

### Testing

Testing of problems involves at least 3 things:

- Testing that an incorrect flag is incorrect
- Testing that a correct flag is correct
- Testing that the correct flag can be found by using the materials given for
  the problem.

1. To test an incorrect flag, try submitting `aaa` as a flag to the problem.
    - Expected output: `That is not the correct flag`
2. To test the correct flag and that the correct flag can be found using the
   given materials, download the flag from the problem and submit it
    - Expected output: `Correct`

These steps ensure that `/challenge/metadata.json` was created correctly. This
is just basic, functional testing of your problem. A lot of testing  goes into
appropriately adjusting the difficulty of a problem and making it challenging
enough to be interesting, but still accessible.

## Conclusion

With this guide, we saw everything that goes into creating a simple sanity
problem. Besides the challenge files, the Dockerfile and problem.md are the most
important files.

We also demonstrated some basic testing practices by proving that an incorrect
flag is incorrect, a correct flag is correct, and that the player can get the
correct flag from the materials given.

This is the simplest challenge in a series designed to familiarize new authors
with the cmgr format for picoCTF problems. Other guides here will demonstrate
generating a dynamic flag, creating challenges for other traditional CTF
categories and more!
