# Example Problems

These example problems proceed roughly in order of complexity, from least
complex challenge to most complex challenge. These are great problems to start
problem development with.

1. [Sanity, static flag](/example-problems/sanity-static-flag/)
2. [Forensics Grep](/example-problems/forensics-grep/)
3. [Forensics Disk](/example-problems/forensics-disk/)
4. [Custom Service](/example-problems/custom-service/)
5. [Custom SSH (Multi-stage Dockerfile)](/example-problems/custom-ssh/)
6. [Custom Web](/example-problems/custom-web/)

In addition to these walkthroughs, you can also check the `cmgr` developers'
[example problems,](https://github.com/picoCTF/cmgr/tree/master/examples) which
are a good source for more complex problem development.
